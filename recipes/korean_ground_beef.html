<h2>Korean Ground Beef</h2>
<p>I really like ground beef. It's cheap, readily available, very versatile, and when you buy the vacuum-sealed packages, it lasts for quite a while too. It also freezes easily and thaws well.</p>
<p>So I always have a few packages in the fridge or in the freezer. I mostly use them for easy everyday recipes such as burgers, meatballs, casseroles, and meatloaf.</p>
<p>But when I want to make something special and especially flavorful, I make Korean ground beef.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>¼ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce (or use a gluten-free alternative and add salt as needed)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon honey or a liquid sugar-free alternative</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons avocado oil</li>
    <li>1 lb. lean ground beef (85/15)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
    <li>¼ cup thinly sliced green onions green parts only</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In a small bowl, prepare the sauce by whisking together the soy sauce, honey, cornstarch, and red pepper flakes. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Add the beef and cook, stirring, until no longer pink, breaking it up into crumbles as you cook, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Drain the beef. Return it to the skillet. Add the garlic and the ginger to the skillet and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Stir the sauce into the beef. Cook for 2 more minutes, until heated through and the sauce thickens.</li>
    <li>Off heat, drizzle the dish with sesame oil, sprinkle it with green onions, and serve.</li>
</ol>
